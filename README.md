### Description

This app stores code in text formats, and is represent via a tree view. I submitted a version before, but this has been re-written from scratch, and is a lot faster with more features and more codes. I only really uploaded it because I was asked to (see old submission). It's not finished or anything, but I hope you'll find it useful. I update the compiled version from time to time on my site (http://www.rickbull.co.uk/).

UPDATE: Finished the code for "Add New Section" and also started the code for showing the root node (so you can add a new section in the root, but that's not yet finished).
